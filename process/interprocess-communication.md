# Interprocess Communication

Processes which affects / be affected by other processes are called cooperating process. These processes take advantage of:

1. **Information Sharing** : Multiple user can access to same datas like sharing files.
2. **Computation speedup** : We can divide a task into subtasks and process those tasks in parallel.
3. **Modularity** : We may want to divide task into multiple process or threads for modularity.
4. **Convenience** : One user may perform multiple tasks like editing, printing, compiling at same time.

![a. message passing, b. shared memory](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2842%29.png)

Cooperating process needs **Interprocess Communication : IPC**  
There are two models for this: 1. **Shared Memory** 2. **Message Passing**

## Shared Memory System

Other processes which wish to use the shared memory must then make their own system calls to attach the shared memory area onto their address space. 

**Producer-Consumer Example Using Shared Memory**



**Datas on Shared Memory**

```c
#define BUFFER_SIZE 10

typedef struct {
     . . .
} item;

item buffer[ BUFFER_SIZE ];
int in = 0;
int out = 0;
```

**Producer**

```c
item nextProduced;
while( true ) {
      nextProduced = makeNewItem( . . . );
      
      // waits for space to be available
      while( ( ( in + 1 ) % BUFFER_SIZE ) == out ) {}
      
      buffer[ in ] = nextProduced;
      in = ( in + 1 ) % BUFFER_SIZE;
}
```

**Consumer**

```c
item nextConsumed;
while( true ) {
     // waits for message
     while( in == out ) {}

     nextConsumed = buffer[ out ];
     out = ( out + 1 ) % BUFFER_SIZE;
}
```

## Message Passing System

Message Passing System allow processors to communicate without using shared memory.  
This is useful in distributed system where multiple nodes are connected via networks.

## ETC

* Java does not support shared memory
